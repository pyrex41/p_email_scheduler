Hi {{ first_name }},

We recently reviewed Medigap premiums for your zip code and found some options that might interest you.

These plans offer the same comprehensive benefits you currently enjoy, potentially at a better value. We've done the research to find plans that maintain your coverage while possibly reducing your costs.

Many Medicare beneficiaries don't realize they can be paying different rates for identical coverage. We'd be happy to show you your options and potential savings. If we don't find a better value now, we'll keep monitoring rates and reach out when we find something promising.
